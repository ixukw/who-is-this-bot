# Who-Is-This-Bot
This is a bot I wrote for a private server which stores user-specific information (such as names or grade, etc) via Firebase.
Other users can use commands to fetch data and therefore know who they are messaging.

#### Note: This project is incomplete and still WIP.
There are still bugs and a total lack of error-checking.

## Additional Files
Requires:
- Discord.js v12.
- npm i firebase-admin
- npm i hastebin.js

Requires a config.json with Discord Authentication Token and a Firebase private key json file.
(Obviously requires Firebase Free Tier)
