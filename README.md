# Who-Is-This-Bot
This is a bot I wrote for a private server which stores user-specific information (such as names or grade, etc) via Firebase.
Other users can use commands to fetch data and therefore know who they are messaging.

There are still bugs and a total lack of error-checking.

## Additional Files
Requires:
- Discord.js v12.
- firebase-admin
- hastebin.js

Requires a config.json with specified data in construction section and a Firebase private key json file.

## Known Issues
- Excessively mentions people.
