# Who-Is-This-Bot
This is a bot I wrote for a private server which stores user-specific information (such as names or grade, etc) via Firebase.
Other users can use commands to fetch data and therefore know who they are messaging.

# Additional Files
Requires Discord.js v12 and firebase-admin.
Requires a config.json with Discord Authentication Token and a Firebase private key json file.
(Obviously requires Firebase Free Tier)
